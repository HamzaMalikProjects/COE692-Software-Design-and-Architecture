## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains all course materials and project work completed for **COE692 – Software Design and Architecture**. The course emphasizes scalable software system design, exploring architecture patterns, design methodologies, and embedded applications. Students gained hands-on experience building modular, maintainable systems aligned with modern software engineering principles.

The major course project, **Car Rental Management System**, integrates front-end and back-end components using Java Servlets, JSP, and persistent storage. It reflects a layered architecture and applies MVC principles to manage customer bookings, availability, user authentication, and payment processing.
